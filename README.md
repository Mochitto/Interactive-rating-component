## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Select and submit a number rating
- See the "Thank you" card state after submitting a rating

## My process
I started building from the desktop version, noticing how the mobile version didn't change much, apart from the container.
I struggled with the custom form input, but in the end I was able to find a way to build everything :)

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- SMACSS methodology
- Javascript

### What I learned

- How to build custom radio inputs
- How to avoid submitting a form to stay on the same page
- Manipulating data from javascript and return a new interface

### Continued development

In the future I would love to focus more on the SMACSS methodology's separation of concerns and create the different components with react.
